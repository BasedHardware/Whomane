## Assembling instructions

### Connect Camera to raspberry Pi


You have a Raspberry Pi board that looks like this ![zero2-close-up](https://github.com/kodjima33/ADeus/assets/43514161/c9f5ce13-9e63-48ca-b930-4f13501b4de4)

Your goal is to attach the camera via a short ribbon cable that you received along with your raspberry Pi Kit.

[Here is a more detailed video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFAX4pH1BPA)

This is what you should end up with: 

![IMG_0157](https://github.com/BasedSocialCo/whomane/assets/43514161/2818227f-4780-49dd-b2ec-90ca1141ffba)

After you connect the camera, turn over everything and put a little bit of double-sided tape on the back of your camera
![IMG_0158](https://github.com/BasedSocialCo/whomane/assets/43514161/d229726d-270b-4e29-a05a-ffcf78726435)

Finally, attach your camera to your raspberry Pi with tape
![CleanShot 2024-03-05 at 20 45 47](https://github.com/BasedSocialCo/whomane/assets/43514161/3df341b2-4f9d-4439-a8eb-5af412d9530b)




### Step2: Connect the button

You will need to insert button's 2 (of 4 total) contacts into the board so that 2 contacts will be left unused.   
![IMG_0159](https://github.com/BasedSocialCo/whomane/assets/43514161/6deaba8e-ee26-49e8-9cb8-714c6e88eb6f)

The pins you will use are #5 and #7 on the row that is closer to the border of your Pi (see picture below)

![IMG_0160](https://github.com/BasedSocialCo/whomane/assets/43514161/34f8ea0c-b3d2-4a6e-ba68-78efeb305924)

After you insert button's contacts into the board, take a screwdriver or keys or anything solid and bend the contacts so that the button wouldn't fall off.

### Step3: Prepare Pi sugar
Raspberry Pi sugar has good magnets which we will use as our Pin holder



Take something sharp (knife) and carefully remove both big circle magnets from your Pi Sugar. 

![IMG_0163](https://github.com/BasedSocialCo/whomane/assets/43514161/2701fc55-7295-4bd9-baf9-f8e43fd71187)

After, put double-sided tape on your battery and attach the battery to the battery's board

As the last step, attach one of the magnets to the back of your battery and keep the 2nd magnet (you'll use it to "hang" the Pin on your clothes)

![IMG_0164](https://github.com/BasedSocialCo/whomane/assets/43514161/055cd708-7cbe-417a-b4e9-df9b3fda2466)

### 4. Attach Pi sugar battery to raspberry Pi

Step 1: unpack your Raspberry pi sugar battery. it should contain 4-5 screws

Step 2: Following [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XA4j9hRiFmw), attach your Pi Sugar to your Raspberry Pi. Note that this video may have screws you don't have (and you don't need them). Attach directly with your screws.

Done! You have assembled the hardware! You should end up with something like this 
(note that button may be located in a different place. In this picture I used different location)

### 6. Install software and run
Navigate to Software guide to install software on your Pin and run it
